## 📂 Featured Projects

| Project | What I Did / What I Learned |
|---|---|
| **[Scalable-MLOps-Pipeline-for-Credit-Risk-Prediction](https://github.com/clusterloggs/Scalable-MLOps-Pipeline-for-Credit-Risk-Prediction)** | Built a full ML pipeline for credit risk: data ingestion, feature engineering, model training / evaluation. Learned about scaling, reproducibility, and model versioning. |
| **[Healthcare-Data-Pipeline-GCS-BigQuery](https://github.com/clusterloggs/Healthcare-Data-Pipeline-GCS-BigQuery)** | Designed ETL/data pipeline moving health-data from GCS to BigQuery, prepared clean datasets for downstream analysis. Improved skills in cloud data flow and scalable data prep. |
| **[Boston-MEDV-House-Prediction](https://github.com/clusterloggs/Boston-MEDV-House-Prediction)** | Regression project to predict housing prices. Worked on feature selection, model evaluation, and interpreting model outputs.  |
| **[Taxi-Fare-Prediction-with-BigQuery-ML](https://github.com/clusterloggs/Taxi-Fare-Prediction-with-BigQuery-ML)** | Used BigQuery ML to build regression models on large dataset, optimized queries and evaluated performance at scale. |
| **[Customer-Churn](https://github.github.com/clusterloggs/Customer-Churn)** | Analyzed triggers of churn, built classification model, visualized results. Strengthened skills in business impact and presentation of findings. : |
| **[Feature-Engineering-with-Keras](https://github.com/clusterloggs/feature-engineering-with-keras)** | Hands-on work with feature preprocessing and engineering for different data types using Keras / TensorFlow. Better understanding of how features affect model performance. |

## 🛠 What I’m Working On Next

- Improve model deployment / continuous integration / continuous delivery (CI/CD) for ML projects  
- More end-to-end projects using unstructured data (text, maybe images)  
- Deepen cloud skills (especially AWS / GCP) and build more projects that include both data pipelines + deployment
